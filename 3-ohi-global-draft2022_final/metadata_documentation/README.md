### Layers metadata

Layers metadata are split into several relational data files, each containing related information.  [This document](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B7cIhYsFwBeNdkZNck9PaFJDQ1E) describes each of the data files and how they are organized. The document also includes information on how to update the tables if there are changes to the layers.
