See **`r layer_meta$name[layer_meta$layer == 'mar_coastalpopn_inland25mi']`** for more information about the population data.

Coastal population data was converted to average coastal density by dividing by the total 25 mile inland area.  We then rescaled the data to have values between 0-1, by logging the density data and then dividing by the ln (maximum density) across all regions and years.
