Methods follow those described for the **`r layer_meta$name[layer_meta$layer == 'po_nutrients']`** layer.  However, the rescaled data were clipped to include only pixels within 3nm offshore, and the zonal mean for each region was calculated using this subset of data.

For the clean waters goal calculations, the inverse of the pressure values is used (1 minus nutrient pressure).
